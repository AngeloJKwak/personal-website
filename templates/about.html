                Hey, I’m Angelo — an AI Engineer who loves turning data and ideas into something real. 
                I’ve always been curious about how things work, and that curiosity naturally led me to the world of data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-6">
                I currently work at Blue Mountain, where I help design and build AI systems that make complex processes simpler and smarter. 
                Over the years, I’ve worked across data engineering, business intelligence, and AI development — giving me a hands-on perspective from raw data all the way to real, working applications.

                What drives me is the creative side of technology — figuring out how to use AI not just to automate tasks, but to actually assist people and make their work easier. 
                Whether that’s a chatbot that understands your system, a visual inspection model that spots what humans might miss, or a predictive tool that helps teams make better decisions — I love the challenge of bringing those ideas to life.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Outside of work, I’m usually experimenting with new side projects, exploring ways AI can cross over into everyday life, or just diving down another rabbit hole of learning something new.
                When I do decide to take off my "technical" hat, I love to exercise, play volleyball, spend time with my amazing wife and our corgi, Cheddar.
            </p>

                I've been an avid gamer since I was a kid, and that passion has stuck with me. 
                As a die-hard PC gamer, I built my own gaming rig from scratch and have helped friends and family build theirs too. 
                Gaming was actually what first sparked my interest in technology — taking apart hardware, understanding how components work together, and optimizing performance. That curiosity has only deepened over the years.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-6">
                If there’s a theme to what I do, it’s this: keep learning, keep building, and keep finding smarter ways to solve problems.
